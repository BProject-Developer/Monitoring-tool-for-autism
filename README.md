# Monitoring Tool for Autism  
*Developed by DecaTech*

## Overview  
**Monitoring Tool for Autism** is the first project developed by the **DecaTech** team, aiming to support inclusive education by addressing clinical characteristics found in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This project analyzes clinical indicators based on **EKG (Electrocardiogram)** and **NH₃ (Ammonia)** data. These datasets are derived from the first Indonesian research in this field by **Marchelliant et al. (2021)**.  
This tool builds upon that study, offering real-time data logging and comparison between different clustering methods for behavioral pattern recognition and analysis.

## Features  
- **Real-time Behavior Logging**  
  Instantly log behavioral changes with an intuitive user interface.  
- **Custom Behavior Categories**  
  Add and manage behavior categories tailored to individual needs.  
- **Report Generation**  
  Export structured reports for therapy sessions or medical consultations.  
- **User-friendly Interface**  
  Designed to be accessible for both professionals and non-technical users.  
- **Data Storage & Security**  
  Store data locally or optionally in the cloud, with user privacy as a top priority.
